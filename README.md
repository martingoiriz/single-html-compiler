# Simple compiler to single HTML file

Compile HTML/CSS/JS into a single minified HTML file

# Usage

You must have a folder with an **index.html** file and other two files with **.css** and **.js** extensions.

#### For example:

**Users/martingoiriz/Desktop/myProject**

    	|--index.html
    	|--index.js
    	|--styles.css

Once you've cloned the project, open it in your terminal and run:

#### $ `node compiler.js --path=/Users/martingoiriz/Desktop/myProject`

Reeplacing the path with your project's path. It will generate a build folder with an **index.html** altogether and minified
